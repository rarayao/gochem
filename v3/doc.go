/*Package v3 implements a Matrix type representing a row-major 3D matrix (i.e. a Nx3 matrix).
The v3.Matrix is used to represent the cartesian coordinates of sets of atoms in goChem.
It is based int gonum's (github.com/gonum) Dense type, with some additional restrictions
because of the fixed number of columns and with some additional functions that were found
useful for the purposes of goChem.
